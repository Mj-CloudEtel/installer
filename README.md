OPNsense installer
==================

A scriptable replacement for the legacy installer (bsdinstaller) based
on the FreeBSD installer (bsdinstall).  It is currently under development.

The repository holds our script adjustments which are workflow and
branding related, but plug seamlessly into the base directory.

The "opnsense-installer" port will be mostly a placeholder for the
script installation and keeping the cpdup dependency as we do not want
to offer distribution sets installation since we have a live system.
